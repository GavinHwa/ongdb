= ONgDB - fork of Neo4j Enterprise: Graphs for Everyone =

https://graphfoundation.org/projects/ongdb/[Open Native Graph DB (ONgDB)] is a fork of the https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j[neo4j project]
that continues development of the neo4j enterprise codebase as a fully open source project after
https://graphfoundation.org/neo4j-is-open-core-now-what-ujah7ein5mis/[Neo4j Incâ€™s Open Core Shift]
that closed ongoing development and removed existing source code.

ONgDB is a high performance, native graph store with everything you would expect from an enterprise-ready database,
including high availability clustering, ACID transactions, and uses the intuitive, pattern-centric open cypher query language.
Developers use graph theory-based structures that we call nodes and relationships instead of rows and columns.
For many use cases, ONgDB will provide orders of magnitude performance benefits compared to non-native graph, relational and NoSQL databases.

== Using ONgDB ==

ONgDB is available as a standalone server, an embeddable component or a Docker image.
You can https://graphfoundation.org/projects/ongdb/[download distributions] from our CDN or
https://hub.docker.com/r/graphfoundation/ongdb[pull images] from DockerHub.

== Extending ONgDB ==
We encourage experimentation with ONgDB. You can build extensions to ONgDB, develop library or drivers atop the product,
or make contributions directly to the product core. You'll need to sign a Contributor License Agreement in order for us to accept your patches.

NOTE: This GitHub repository contains mixed GPL and AGPL code. The Community edition (in the link:community/[community/] directory) is GPLv3.
The Enterprise edition (link:enterprise/[enterprise/]) is licensed under the AGPLv3.

== Dependencies ==

ONgDB is built using https://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven] version 3.3 and a recent version of supported VM.
Bash and Make are also required. Note that maven needs more memory than the standard configuration, this can be achieved with `export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx512m"`.

macOS users need to have https://brew.sh/[Homebrew] installed.

=== With brew on macOS ===

  brew install maven

Please note that we do not support building Debian packages on macOS.

=== With apt-get on Ubuntu ===

  sudo apt install maven openjdk-11-jdk

On top of that, to build Debian packages:

  apt install debhelper devscripts dos2unix dpkg make xmlstarlet

== Building ONgDB ==

Before you start running the unit and integration tests in the ONgDB Maven project on a Linux-like system,
you should ensure your limit on open files is set to a reasonable value.
You can test it with `ulimit -n`. We recommend you have a limit of at least 40K.

* A plain `mvn clean install` will only build the individual jar files.
* Test execution is, of course, part of the build.
* In case you just want the jars, without running tests, this is for you: `mvn clean install -DskipTests`.
* To build product packages, do `export PATH="bin:$PATH" && make clean all` in the packaging directory after building artifacts with Maven.
* To build the documentation see the https://github.com/graphfoundation/ongdb-documentation/[ONgDB documentation].
* If you are running into problems building on Windows you can try building ONgDB in a Ubuntu virtual machine.
* You may need to increase the memory available to Maven: `export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx512m"`.

== Running ONgDB ==

After running a `mvn clean install`, `cd` into `packaging/standalone/target` and extract the version you want.
If you are not building from source you can start from a https://github.com/graphfoundation/ongdb/releases[published release].

=== Linux/macOS
On Linux/macOS you want to run:

  bin/neo4j start

in the extracted folder to start ONgDB on `localhost:7474`.

=== Windows
On Windows you want to run:

  bin\neo4j start

in the extracted folder to start ONgDB on `localhost:7474`.

=== Maven
If you are not interested in the tarballs and just want to run ONgDB you can instead run a `mvn clean install -DminimalBuild`
and then `cd` into `community/server` and run:

  mvn clean compile exec:java

to start ONgDB.

=== Docker
To run with Docker execute the following:

 docker run \
    --publish=7474:7474 --publish=7687:7687 \
    --volume=$HOME/ongdb/data:/data \
    graphfoundation/ongdb:3.6

to start `localhost:7474`. See https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/graphfoundation/ongdb[DockerHub] for published release tags and more details.

== Licensing ==

ONgDB Community Edition is an open source product licensed under GPLv3.

ONgDB Enterprise Edition expands the functionality of Community Edition with Enterprise-grade features.

ONgDB Enterprise Edition consists of modules from ONgDB Community Edition and modules licensed under AGPLv3 in this repository.

== Misc ==
ONgDB IDE code style configs can be found at under the build/ folder of this repository.
